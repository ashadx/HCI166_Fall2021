## Core Problem:Double Diamond FrameWork

Children living in poverty face many barriers to accessing an education. Some are obvious like not having a school to go to ,while others are more subtle. Like the teacher at the school not having had the training needed to help children learn effectively.

1. A lack of funding for education.
2. Having no teacher, or having an untrained teacher
3. No proper classrooms.
4. A lack of learning materials
5. The exclusion of children with disabilities.

Above mentions are some of the problems that are being faced by underprivileged schools ,We have generated some idea for there solutions which can become a sloution for there problems. We have to design these applications in such a user friendly and interactive manner so it can be used generally by everyone not just those who are familiar using computer or smartphones but for those who have never used them before and all will be done by using the concepts of HCI.

## FINAL 10 IDEA'S

### Idea 1 : Applying Solar Sysyem (original by [Riyan])

### Idea 3: Using Subtitiles in lectures (original by [Riyan])

By applying subtitles student can listen and read the subtitiles at same time,so which word he\she cannot listen can understand by reading in video.
It is also helpfull for the students you can not listen properly ,they can understand the lectures by reading subtitles.


|**Pros**|**Cons**|
|:-----:|-----|

### Idea 4: UI Human Friendly (orginial by[Asad])

In hybrid classroom the app or website that are used by student and teachers should be user friendly so they should not face any problem in using that medium.
As HCI play an important role in every aspect of your life .

|**Pros|**Cons**|

|:----:|------|
|We donot have to write down long notes we can just copy and use it.|They are costly |
|We can storage large amount of data|Limited data canbe stored.|


### Idea 6:Online temptations.

We can make online interaction of students and teahcer through our application so student can feel for a moment that they are not sitting at home but they are properly attending there classs and can communicate with there mates easily.

In hybrid class if a every teacher will take lecture using word or note pad it will be difficult for them to take because of thier typeing skills.
|**Pros**|**Cons**|
|:----:|------|
|It will not time for computer science teacher|It will take time for other teacher|
