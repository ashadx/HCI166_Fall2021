## Senerios:

* idea 1: [**using subtitles in lecture**.]
##### Idea 1 : using subtitles in lecture.
###### Senerio 1 : student 1 (far from school)

Askari is 15 year old boy who used to live 20 km far from his school ,he always has to face travelling problems and considering this that he also had to  work in part time to run his expenses .He can take online lectures but one problem that he will face is that without using handfrees he can not listen properly so we are making an app that has also subtitle function in it that a user can read and listen at same time.

###### Senerio 2 : student 2 (near  from school)
Abdul Basit is a student of class 10 and he is just 18 year old but as increasing in age make him more responsible .So he also had to go o job and manage his school as well,but in pandemic all work that can be done from home are being done in home.As well as online lecture can also be taken in home and taking it with subtitles can had a affictive impact on user.

###### Senerio 3 : Teacher 1 (old )
As HE is an old teacher so in his whole 22 year career he had not face such issues that are being faced during pandemic,all work that are done is new to him ,so also the lecture that are being recorded with subtitles so the one who is taking lectures can read and listen at same time .

###### Senerio 4 :  teacher 2(young)
As he is young faculty he had not to faced many problems as senior teacher had faced during pandemic. He want to give the lecture once a time to offline and online student. We can suggest her to our application which she can easily take tests , queries, student interest and share all data which is required. She also take boards pens , marker in meeting to teach proper maths problem to her students.so we introduce that lectures that are recorded can be recorded with  subtitles.

  
  
* idea 2:[**UI human friendly.**]
 ##### Idea : UI human friendly.
###### Scenario 1 : jr.staff 
M.Nadeem is as junior staff member and he is recently gradute so he is under traning process and his dutuies are to make time table ,class availability and it support .So as pandemic same all work are done by home and it is obvious that the work is done through any website or an app .The application that all has to user friendly that any can easily use it .He get an idea to an app that can easily use without any help.

###### Scenario 2 : Senior staff.
As he is senior staff member his duties are to make lineup all the works that would take place in a day and after listen that to the news of pandemic all the activities will be done in home ,so he will face difficulties in doning his work but his staff members suggested an idea to make an application that can used by students ,teacher and staff as well.

###### Scenario 3: student 1 (far from school)
AS Askari is living far from school he can not attend his classes regularly and on time and after an imposed of lockdown and hybrid classes are becoming so usefull. So he has an idea that an application should be design that UI is understandable by staff  ,teachers and students so they can  conduct lectures ,quiz and exam online.
###### Scenario 4: student 2 (near to school)
Abdul Basit is 18 year old an living near to school but he also do odd jobs to run his expenses so some time he cannot attend quiz and assignment but  during pandemic he can take all his quiz and assignment online by downloading an application thatâ€™s UI is as easy as smiling.

###### Scenario 1: Senior Teacher.
As he is am senior teacher ,he has to travel a lot from one district to another or from one city to another and country as well. Its  very difficult to carry all lectures and notes with him  always so our student gave them an idea to carry an portable device that can help him to carry lectures and notes with him any time and any where,by using portable devices he can also share notes with students and other teachers.

 ###### Scenario 2: Jr. Teacher.
As he is newly joined so he has many task to do and had to prepare notes before giving a lecture but carry them is difficult and there are many chances of losting. After covid when classes are conducted online he can not give notes to every student one by one ,now he has an idea to carry an portable device with him so he can take lecture and provide notes without any burden .

###### Scenario 3: Senior staff.
Azam is an senior staff member and as senior staff there some duties to provide some work and software that are not installed in another devices ,so he also uses portable devices to carry softwares so he can share them with any one with out any interption.

###### Scenario 4: Student (far from home).
Askari live 20 km away from his school so he usually do not attend classes and misses his lectues and some times miss place his notes and some time forget them in home but now he is being free because he used portable device for carry lecture notes and assignmnets.
