## Senerios:

* idea 1: [**using subtitles in lecture**.]
##### Idea 1 : using subtitles in lecture.
###### Senerio 1 : student 1 (far from school)

Askari is 15 year old boy who used to live 20 km far from his school ,he always has to face travelling problems and considering this that he also had to  work in part time to run his expenses .He can take online lectures but one problem that he will face is that without using handfrees he can not listen properly so we are making an app that has also subtitle function in it that a user can read and listen at same time.

###### Senerio 2 : student 2 (near  from school)
Abdul Basit is a student of class 10 and he is just 18 year old but as increasing in age make him more responsible .So he also had to go o job and manage his school as well,but in pandemic all work that can be done from home are being done in home.As well as online lecture can also be taken in home and taking it with subtitles can had a affictive impact on user.

###### Senerio 3 : Teacher 1 (old )
As HE is an old teacher so in his whole 22 year career he had not face such issues that are being faced during pandemic,all work that are done is new to him ,so also the lecture that are being recorded with subtitles so the one who is taking lectures can read and listen at same time .

###### Senerio 4 :  teacher 2(young)
As he is young faculty he had not to faced many problems as senior teacher had faced during pandemic. He want to give the lecture once a time to offline and online student. We can suggest her to our application which she can easily take tests , queries, student interest and share all data which is required. She also take boards pens , marker in meeting to teach proper maths problem to her students.so we introduce that lectures that are recorded can be recorded with  subtitles.

  
  
* idea 2:**UI human friendly.

###### Scenario 1 : jr.staff 
M.Nadeem is as junior staff member and he is recently gradute so he is under traning process and his dutuies are to make time table ,class availability and it support .So as pandemic same all work are done by home and it is obvious that the work is done through any website or an app .The application that all has to user friendly that any can easily use it .He get an idea to an app that can easily use without any help.

###### Scenario 2 : Senior staff.
