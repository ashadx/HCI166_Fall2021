## BackGround:
First we had selected 20 ideas each and them short listed them into 10 which can be implemented on the running system .The idea that we had finalized is using subtitles in lecture. We had done brainstorming and thing a lot for the improvement and implementation of hybrid classroom for an underprivileged schools.The idea that we had finalized is that many students can not take online sessions of their classes ,some because of having internet issues ,some having medium issues and other are busy in their jobs to run their home.So we had decided to provide an online recorded lecture with subtitles so a student that can not listen to lectures properly they can read and understand at the same time.
