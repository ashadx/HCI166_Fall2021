## Histroy of HCI

Human-computer interaction (HCI) is an area of research and practice that emerged in the early 1980s, initially as a specialty area in computer science embracing cognitive science and human factors engineering.
HCI has expanded rapidly and steadily for three decades, attracting professionals from many other disciplines and incorporating diverse concepts and approaches.
To a considerable extent, HCI now aggregates a collection of semi-autonomous fields of research and practice in human-centered informatics.
However, the continuing synthesis of disparate conceptions and approaches to science and practice in HCI has produced a dramatic example of how different epistemologies and paradigms can be reconciled and integrated in a vibrant and productive intellectual project.

## What is HCI ?
 Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a design field that focuses on the interfaces between people and computers. HCI incorporates multiple disciplines, such as computer science, psychology, human factors, and ergonomics, into one field. Learn the principles of HCI to help you create intuitive and usable interfaces.
 
 ### HUMAN
 By "user", we may mean an individual user, a group of users working together. An appreciation of the way people's sensory systems (sight, hearing, touch) relay information is vital. Also, different users form different conceptions or mental models about their interactions and have different ways of learning and keeping knowledge and. In addition, cultural and national differences play a part.
### COMPUTER
When we talk about the computer, we're referring to any technology ranging from desktop computers, to large scale computer systems. For example, if we were discussing the design of a Website, then the Website itself would be referred to as "the computer". Devices such as mobile phones or VCRs can also be considered to be “computers”.
### INTERACTION

There are obvious differences between humans and machines. In spite of these, HCI attempts to ensure that they both get on with each other and interact successfully. In order to achieve a usable system, you need to apply what you know about humans and computers, and consult with likely users throughout the design process. In real systems, the schedule and the budget are important, and it is vital to find a balance between what would be ideal for the users and what is feasible in reality.


## Contribution of HCI
The field of HCI covers a wide range of topics, and its development has relied on contributions
from many disciplines. Some of the main disciplines which have contributed to HCI are:


#### Computer Science

o technology

o software design, development & maintenance

o User Interface Management Systems (UIMS) & User Interface Development Environments (UIDE)

o prototyping tools

o graphics


 ##### Cognitive Psychology
o information processing
o capabilities
o limitations
o cooperative working
o performance prediction


#### Social Psychology
o social & organizational structures



#### Ergonomics/Human Factors
o hardware design
o display readability


#### Linguistics
o natural language interfaces


#### Artificial Intelligence
o intelligent software


#### Philosophy, Sociology & Anthropology
o Computer supported cooperative work (CSCW)


#### Engineering & Design
o graphic design
o engineering principles
